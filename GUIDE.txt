Don't restart your phone!
Required a lot of patience (File Explorer can easily crash....)

Copy "Aow shortcut" on your phone (for example in Documents)
Go to your phone, launch File Explorer, go to Documents, and open "Aow shortcut".
You will be ported in this path: "C:\Data\Users\DefApps\APPDATA\Local\Aow"
Go to data > local > tmp > BusyBox
Go now to common folder.
Copy "busybox" file and press the Up button. You will go "back"
Press it as much as you see the RootFS folder (You need to be in Aow directory)
Open RootFS > system > xbin and copy here.

Go to Aow shortcut.
Go to data > local > tmp > Gapps > app.
Select all files and copy them to RootFS > app
Do the same thing with etc - lib - framework.
Remember: Don't copy the folder; copy files from that folder (or File Explorer will duplicate the folder...)
For etc folder, you need to copy g.prop and preferred-apps on etc folder (RootFS), then go into permissions (Gapps folder) and copy all files on RootFS\etc\Permissions, to prevent duplicated folder.

After finished, restart your phone, and then continue
